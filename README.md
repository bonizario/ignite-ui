# Ignite UI

Ignite UI is a monorepo focused on building UI components with React and Stitches.

## Packages

The main packages in the project are:

1. `docs`: contains the documentation for the project, which is built with Storybook.

2. `eslint-config`: provides a shared ESLint configuration that can be used across different packages in the project.

3. `react`: includes all React components built with Stitches, a modern styling library.

4. `tokens`: groups all the design tokens used in both the React components and the documentation.
